# IlluminatiConfirmed
######Enter a name. No matter what it is, this program will somehow find a way to link it to the Illuminati.

This program is quite buggy and there are a lot of places that it could be improved.
It's just another one of my pointless programs that I make for the sake of *NaN*

---
####Places where it could be improved:
- Images Don't Load Sometimes
- Incomplete Image List
- Sounds sometimes don't play
- Character limit is 10 Chars (easy fix)
- Inefficient coding in several places
- Incomplete "Relate.Number" class
- A lot of things are incomplete, like I said
- Endings are boring (At least it was for my pre-alpha tester/brother)

####Preview:
(btw the Console speaks to you and has dramatic music as well as (if you're lucky) pictures (of less than 1/5 of the items in the directory)

INPUT: PixelZerg

PixelZerg

PixelZerg has 9 letters

You know what else also has 9 letters?

I have no idea (even if it can't find a word with 9 letters in its directory, the show must go on!)

the word idea has 4 letters

you know what else also has 4 letters?

that's right,

moss

moss is green, you know what else is green?

that's right, basil.

Basil has 5 letters

4 + 5 = 9

etc etc
